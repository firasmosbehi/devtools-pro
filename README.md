# DevTools Pro

Cross-platform (Android & iOS) Flutter app bundling everyday developer utilities in one place.

## What’s inside (initial roadmap)
- Regex builder/tester
- Cron expression designer with next-run preview
- CIDR calculator & subnet splitter
- JWT/JWS decoder and verifier
- Data format converters (JSON ⇄ YAML ⇄ TOML)
- Clipboard-friendly snippets and offline-first UX

## Getting started
- Prereqs: Flutter 3.38+, Dart 3.10+
- Run: `flutter pub get && flutter run`
- Tests: `flutter test`

## Project goals
- Opinionated, fast workflows for common backend/devops tasks
- Work fully offline; sync/backup is optional and private
- Accessible UI with keyboard shortcuts where supported

## Contributing
Issues and PRs are welcome. Please run `flutter format` and `flutter test` before submitting.
